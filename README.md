thesethese are actual real exploits however i dont know if they work hence unstable.
Since i dont have wpa3 of wpa2 with pmf on my router and my phones hotspot so maybe u could test it idkk
Iif it does work i will remove it bcuz of githubs policies.

Plus trust me bro wpa3 and pmf bypass is NOT possible especially by a normal person like me.
